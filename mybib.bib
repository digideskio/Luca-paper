   abstract    = {This paper presents a case-study on the performance
                 achieved by the mechanical interactions of
                 self-assembling mobile robots. This study is based on the
                 hand-bot robot, designed to operate within heterogeneous
                 swarms of robots. The hand-bot is specialized in object
                 manipulation and can improve its performance by
                 exploiting physical collaborations by self-assembling
                 with other hand-bots or with foot-bots (ground robots).
                 The paper analyzes the achieved performance and
                 demonstrates the highly super-linear properties of the
                 accessible volume in respect to the number of robots.
                 These extremely interesting performances are strongly
                 linked to the self-assembling mechanisms and the physical
                 nature of the interaction, and do not scale to a large
                 number of robots. Finally, this study suggests that such
                 interesting properties are more accessible for
                 heterogeneous systems or devices achieving complex tasks.},

abstract = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) provide higher information throughput and require shorter training than BCI systems using other brain signals. To elicit an SSVEP, a repetitive visual stimulus (RVS) has to be presented to the user. The RVS can be rendered on a computer screen by alternating graphical patterns, or with external light sources able to emit modulated light. The properties of an RVS (e.g., frequency, color) depend on the rendering device and influence the SSVEP characteristics. This affects the BCI information throughput and the levels of user safety and comfort. Literature on SSVEP-based BCIs does not generally provide reasons for the selection of the used rendering devices or RVS properties. In this paper, we review the literature on SSVEP-based BCIs and comprehensively report on the different RVS choices in terms of rendering devices, properties, and their potential influence on BCI performance, user safety and comfort.},

The angular distance between the robots and the human is estimated using measures of the detected human face, which aids to determine human and multi-UAV localization and positioning. In turn, this is exploited to effectively and naturally make the human select the spatially situated robots. Spatial gestures for selecting robots are presented by the human operator using tangible input devices (i.e., colored gloves). To select individuals and groups of robot we formulate a vocabulary of two-handed spatial pointing gestures. With the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained in a cascaded multi-binary-class configuration, the spatial gestures are effectively learned and recognized by a swarm of UAVs.},

Although some empirical work exists that examines how people collaborate with robots, little is known about how to best design interfaces to support operators in understanding aspects of the task or tasks at hand. This paper presents a design investigation to understand how interfaces should be designed to support multi-user, multirobot teams. Through contextual inquiry, concept generation, and concept evaluation, we determine what operators should see, and with what salience different types of information should be presented. We present our findings through a series of design questions that development teams can use to help define interaction and design interfaces for these systems.},

A command set was compiled from observing users interacting with a simulated interface in a virtual reality environment. We discovered that users find this type of interface intuitive and their commands tend to naturally group into both `High-Level' and `Low-Level' instructions. However, as the robots moved further away, the loss of depth perception and direct feedback was inimical to the interaction. In a second experiment we found that using simple heads up display elements could mitigate these issues.},

Extending our previous work on selecting an individual robot from a population by face engagement, we show that we can dynamically create groups of a desired number of robots by speaking the number we desire, e.g. “You three”, and looking at the robots we intend to form the group. We evaluate two different methods of detecting which robots are intended by the user, and show that an iterated election performs well in our setting. We also show that teams can be modified by adding and removing individual robots: “And you. Not you”. The success of the system is examined for different spatial configurations of robots with respect to each other and the user to find the proper workspace of selection methods.},

abstract={Extending our previous work in real-time vision-based Human Robot Interaction (HRI) with multi-robot systems, we present the first example of creating, modifying and commanding teams of UAVs by an uninstrumented human. To create a team the user focuses attention on an individual robot by simply looking at it, then adds or removes it from the current team with a motion-based hand gesture. Another gesture commands the entire team to begin task execution. Robots communicate among themselves by wireless network to ensure that no more than one robot is focused, and so that the whole team agrees that it has been commanded. Since robots can be added and removed from the team, the system is robust to incorrect additions. A series of trials with two and three very low-cost UAVs and off-board processing demonstrates the practicality of our approach.},

abstract={Multi-robot remote driving has traditionally been a difficult problem. Whenever an operator is forced to divide his limited resources (attention, cognition, etc.) among multiple robots, control becomes complicated and performance deteriorates as a result. Thus, we need to find ways to make command generation and coordination efficient, so that human-robot interaction becomes transparent and tasks are easy to perform. In this paper, we discuss how human-robot collaboration and dialogue provide an effective framework for achieving this.},
